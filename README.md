# HOS

## To-Do / Discussion
### Homepage
Homepage (Post Login) would contain basic productivity widgets to assist with productivity such as A To-Do list, Weather, Calendar and Time

On the top right of the page there would be a hamburger menu that can be used to access HOS settings, here users can adjust various settings such as their nickname, toggle widgets on and off and change the background image with unsplash URLs
